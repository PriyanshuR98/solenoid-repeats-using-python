Solenoid Structure Recognition in Protein Sequences using Discrete Transforms
Introduction
Welcome to the repository for Solenoid Structure Recognition in Protein Sequences! This project focuses on the identification of repeats and non-repeats in protein sequences, a crucial task in molecular biology. Understanding these structural patterns is vital for unraveling the functions and characteristics of proteins.

In biological systems, proteins often exhibit repeated structural motifs, forming solenoid structures. Recognizing these repeats is essential for gaining insights into the architecture and functionality of proteins.

Motivation
Identifying repeats in protein sequences has significant implications in understanding various biological processes. Repeats often play crucial roles in protein-protein interactions, molecular recognition, and cellular functions. Recognizing these patterns aids in deciphering the underlying mechanisms of various diseases and can contribute to drug discovery and design.

Discrete Transforms and Formulation
The methodology employed in this project leverages Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) for recognizing solenoid structures in protein sequences. The conceptual foundation is derived from the work of Artchely (2005). The DFT formulation provides a powerful mathematical framework for mapping and analyzing repetitive patterns in the protein sequences.

Parameters: ZScore and Theta Ratio
Two key parameters, ZScore and Theta Ratio, are calculated based on the DFT results. These parameters serve as quantitative measures for characterizing the significance and nature of the identified repeats. They play a pivotal role in the subsequent classification process.

SVM Model for Classification
To classify repeats and non-repeats, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is employed. The SVM model utilizes the ZScore and Theta Ratio parameters to make predictions. The model has been trained on a dataset annotated with known solenoid structures, enabling it to effectively distinguish between repeats and non-repeats.
